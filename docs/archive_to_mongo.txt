archive mongo to hive table optimized way/code

To archive data from MongoDB to a Hive table, you can use the following steps:

Install the MongoDB connector for Hadoop. You can download it from the MongoDB website.

Create a Hive table that matches the structure of the MongoDB collection you want to archive. For example:
CREATE TABLE my_collection (
  field1 string,
  field2 int,
  field3 double
)
STORED AS ORC;


Use Sqoop to import the data from MongoDB into HDFS. Sqoop is a tool that can be used to transfer data between Hadoop and relational databases.

sqoop import \
--connect mongodb://host:port/database.collection \
--username <username> \
--password <password> \
--table <collection> \
--target-dir /path/to/hdfs/directory \
--as-avrodatafile \
--delete-target-dir

This command will import the data from MongoDB into HDFS as Avro files. The --delete-target-dir option will delete the target directory if it already exists.

Create an external Hive table that points to the Avro files in HDFS. For example:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_archive (
  field1 string,
  field2 int,
  field3 double
)
STORED AS AVRO
LOCATION '/path/to/hdfs/directory';


This command creates an external table that points to the Avro files in HDFS. The STORED AS AVRO clause tells Hive to use the Avro file format.

Use an INSERT INTO statement to insert the data from the external Hive table into the main Hive table. For example:

INSERT INTO my_collection
SELECT field1, field2, field3
FROM my_archive;


This command inserts the data from the external Hive table into the main Hive table.

By following these steps, you can archive data from MongoDB to a Hive table in an optimized way. The use of Avro files can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between Hadoop and MongoDB.

how to handle if column added or deleted in the mongo table 

If a column is added or deleted in the MongoDB collection, you will need to update the Hive table schema to reflect the changes. You can follow the steps below to handle these changes:

Update the Hive table schema to match the new MongoDB collection schema. You can do this using the ALTER TABLE statement. For example, to add a new column to the Hive table:
ALTER TABLE my_collection ADD COLUMN field4 string;


And to delete a column from the Hive table:
ALTER TABLE my_collection DROP COLUMN field3;

If you added a new column to the Hive table, you will need to update your Sqoop import command to include the new column. For example:
sqoop import \
--connect mongodb://host:port/database.collection \
--username <username> \
--password <password> \
--table <collection> \
--target-dir /path/to/hdfs/directory \
--as-avrodatafile \
--delete-target-dir \
--columns "field1, field2, field3, field4"


The --columns option specifies the list of columns to import from the MongoDB collection.

After updating the Hive table schema and Sqoop import command, you can run the same process as before to import the data from MongoDB into Hive.

By following these steps, you can handle changes in the MongoDB collection schema and keep the Hive table schema in sync with the MongoDB collection schema. However, it's important to note that deleting a column from the MongoDB collection will result in the data for that column being lost, and adding a column to the MongoDB collection will result in that column being empty for existing documents until they are updated with a value.



*****************************************************************************************************************************************
is it possible to delete column in hive external table

Yes, it is possible to delete a column from an external Hive table. You can do this using the ALTER TABLE statement with the REPLACE COLUMNS option. Here's an example:

ALTER TABLE my_external_table REPLACE COLUMNS (
  field1 string,
  field2 int
);

This command will replace the existing columns of the external table with the new columns specified in the REPLACE COLUMNS clause. In this example, field3 (the column to be deleted) is not included in the new column list, so it will be dropped from the external table schema.

It's important to note that the REPLACE COLUMNS operation is a metadata-only operation, which means it does not actually modify the underlying data in the table. Therefore, any existing data in the deleted column will remain in the table, but it will not be visible in the Hive query results. If you want to physically delete the data in the deleted column, you will need to use a separate ALTER TABLE statement with the DROP COLUMN option.

Spark Code
------------
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._

val spark = SparkSession.builder()
  .appName("MongoDB to Hive")
  .config("spark.mongodb.input.uri", "mongodb://host:port/database.collection")
  .config("spark.mongodb.input.partitionerOptions.partitionSizeMB", "64")
  .config("spark.sql.sources.partitionColumnTypeInference.enabled", "false")
  .enableHiveSupport()
  .getOrCreate()

// Read data from MongoDB
val mongoDF = spark.read.format("com.mongodb.spark.sql.DefaultSource")
  .option("partitioner", "MongoPaginateBySizePartitioner")
  .load()

// Get the current schema of the MongoDB collection
val mongoSchema = mongoDF.schema

// Get the Hive table schema from the metastore
val hiveSchema = spark.table("my_hive_table").schema

// Check if the MongoDB schema is different from the Hive schema
if (mongoSchema != hiveSchema) {
  // If the schemas are different, update the Hive table schema
  spark.sql(s"ALTER TABLE my_hive_table SET TBLPROPERTIES ('spark.sql.sources.schema'='${mongoSchema.json}')")
}

// Write data to Hive
mongoDF.write.mode("append").insertInto("my_hive_table")


In this example, we first create a SparkSession with the necessary configuration options to read data from MongoDB and write data to Hive. We then use the com.mongodb.spark.sql.DefaultSource data source to read data from the MongoDB collection into a DataFrame.

Next, we get the current schema of the MongoDB collection and the schema of the Hive table from the metastore. We then check if the MongoDB schema is different from the Hive schema, and if it is, we update the Hive table schema using the ALTER TABLE statement.

Finally, we write the data from the DataFrame to the Hive table using the insertInto method.

Note that the spark.sql.sources.partitionColumnTypeInference.enabled configuration option is set to false to disable partition column type inference, which can cause issues when the partition column data type changes between different reads. Instead, we use the MongoPaginateBySizePartitioner partitioner to read data from MongoDB in smaller chunks and avoid these issues.

By using Spark, we can optimize the data transfer process and handle changes in the MongoDB collection schema automatically.


*****************************************************************************************************************************************
if we set spark.sql.sources.schema to latest schema if any column deleted in the mongo collection what would happen to that column in the hive table

If you set spark.sql.sources.schema to the latest schema of the MongoDB collection and a column has been deleted in the collection, the corresponding column in the Hive table will also be deleted during the write process.

When you set spark.sql.sources.schema to the latest schema, Spark will use that schema to write data to the Hive table, and any columns in the Hive table that do not exist in the latest schema will be dropped.

It's important to note that when you set spark.sql.sources.schema to the latest schema, Spark will use that schema to infer the data types of the columns in the DataFrame. If the data types of the columns in the latest schema have changed from their previous data types, this could result in issues with the data being written to the Hive table. For example, if a column that was previously a string is changed to an integer, any rows with non-integer values in that column will fail to write.

To avoid these issues, you should carefully manage schema changes in your MongoDB collection and ensure that any changes are reflected in the Hive table schema before writing data to the table. If you need to handle schema changes dynamically, you can use a combination of schema merging and casting to ensure that the data is written correctly to the Hive table.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************
you mentioned schema merging and casting in hive table, please give me more details

Certainly! When dealing with changes in the schema of a MongoDB collection that is being archived to a Hive table, it's often necessary to merge the new schema with the existing schema of the Hive table. This can be done using the STRUCT data type in Hive, which allows you to define a schema for a nested structure.

For example, let's say you have a Hive table with the following schema:
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  address STRUCT<street: STRING, city: STRING, state: STRING, zip: INT>
)


Now, let's say the schema of your MongoDB collection changes and a new field phone is added. If you simply try to append the new data to the Hive table using the latest schema, the write will fail because the phone field does not exist in the Hive table schema.

To handle this situation, you can merge the new schema with the existing schema of the Hive table using the STRUCT data type. Here's an example of how to do this:

// Read data from MongoDB with the latest schema
val mongoDF = spark.read.format("com.mongodb.spark.sql.DefaultSource")
  .option("partitioner", "MongoPaginateBySizePartitioner")
  .option("spark.mongodb.input.partitionerOptions.partitionSizeMB", "64")
  .option("schema", latestSchema.json)
  .load()

// Define a new Hive table schema with the merged schema
val mergedSchema = StructType(Seq(
  StructField("id", IntegerType),
  StructField("name", StringType),
  StructField("address", StructType(Seq(
    StructField("street", StringType),
    StructField("city", StringType),
    StructField("state", StringType),
    StructField("zip", IntegerType)
  ))),
  StructField("phone", StringType)
))

// Cast the DataFrame to the new schema and write to the Hive table
mongoDF.selectExpr("id", "name", "address.*", "phone")
  .withColumn("address", struct(col("street"), col("city"), col("state"), col("zip")))
  .selectExpr("id", "name", "address", "phone")
  .write.mode("append").insertInto("my_table")


In this example, we read data from MongoDB using the latest schema, which includes the new phone field. We then define a new Hive table schema with the merged schema, which includes the phone field as well as the existing fields from the Hive table schema.

Next, we cast the DataFrame to the new schema using the selectExpr method, and we use the struct function to create a nested structure for the address field. Finally, we write the data to the Hive table using the insertInto method.

By merging the schema in this way, we can handle changes in the MongoDB collection schema and ensure that the data is correctly written to the Hive table. However, it's important to note that this approach may not be appropriate for all situations, and you should carefully consider the specific requirements of your use case before implementing this solution.

explain the data lake architecture approach
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the data lake architecture approach.

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale, and in any format. The data in a data lake is usually stored in its raw form, such as Parquet or ORC files, which can be easily queried and processed by various big data tools, including Apache Hive and Apache Spark SQL.

In the context of archiving a MongoDB collection to a Hive table, a data lake architecture approach would involve storing the data from MongoDB in its raw format in a data lake, and then using Hive or Spark SQL to query and process the data. Here's an example of how this might work:

Use Spark to read the data from MongoDB and write it to a raw data file format such as Parquet or ORC. You can use Spark's built-in support for MongoDB to do this.

val mongoDF = spark.read.format("com.mongodb.spark.sql.DefaultSource")
  .option("partitioner", "MongoPaginateBySizePartitioner")
  .option("spark.mongodb.input.partitionerOptions.partitionSizeMB", "64")
  .load()

mongoDF.write.format("parquet").save("/path/to/parquet/file")

Define an external Hive table that points to the raw data file in the data lake. You can use the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE command to do this.

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  address STRUCT<street: STRING, city: STRING, state: STRING, zip: INT>
)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION '/path/to/parquet/file'

Query the data using Hive or Spark SQL. You can use standard SQL commands to query the data, just as you would with a traditional database.
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE state = 'CA'

The advantages of using a data lake architecture approach include:

Flexibility: Data can be stored in its raw format, allowing you to query and process the data in many different ways.

Scalability: Data lakes can handle large amounts of data, making them suitable for big data use cases.

Cost-effectiveness: Data lakes can be built using low-cost storage options such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Amazon S3.

Future-proofing: Data lakes can accommodate new data sources and data formats, making them more future-proof than traditional data warehousing approaches.

The disadvantages of using a data lake architecture approach include:

Complexity: Data lakes can be complex to set up and manage, especially if you have many different data sources.

Lack of structure: Data in a data lake is often stored in its raw format, which can make it more difficult to query and analyze than data in a structured database.

Security: Data lakes can be more difficult to secure than traditional databases, especially if they are used for sensitive data.

How to handle the mongo collection changes i mean how to replicate that to the hive table
(spark schema merging and casting capabilties
spark schema merging sample while archive data from mongo to hive table
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}

Now, let's say you want to archive this data to a Hive table called mytable. You can use the Spark MongoDB Connector to read data from MongoDB and write it to the mytable table using Spark.

Here's an example code snippet that shows how to use Spark schema merging to handle schema changes while archiving data from MongoDB to a Hive table:

import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
import com.mongodb.spark._
import com.mongodb.spark.config._
import org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode

// Define the schema of the Hive table
val hiveSchema = StructType(Seq(
  StructField("id", IntegerType),
  StructField("name", StringType),
  StructField("age", IntegerType)
))

// Read data from MongoDB using the defined schema
val mongoDF = spark.read.mongo(
  ReadConfig(Map("uri" -> "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb", "collection" -> "mycollection")), 
  Some(hiveSchema)
)

// Write the data to the Hive table, with schema merging enabled
mongoDF
  .write
  .mode(SaveMode.Append)
  .option("mergeSchema", "true") // enable schema merging
  .insertInto("mytable")
In this example, we define the schema of the Hive table as a StructType object and pass it to the spark.read.mongo function using the schema parameter. We then write the data to the mytable table using the write method, with the mergeSchema option set to true to enable schema merging.

When the Spark application runs, it will automatically add new columns to the mytable table if they are present in the incoming data from MongoDB. If a column is deleted from the MongoDB collection, it will not affect the corresponding column in the mytable table because Spark will ignore the missing field during schema merging.


Yes, the mergeSchema option is available in Spark 2.3. You can use this option to enable schema merging when writing data to a data source. Here's an example of how to use the mergeSchema option when writing data to a Parquet file:

scala


from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, IntegerType, StringType

# Define the schema of the Hive table
hive_schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType()),
    StructField("name", StringType()),
    StructField("age", IntegerType())
])

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("MongoDB to Hive") \
    .config("spark.mongodb.input.uri", "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb.mycollection") \
    .config("spark.mongodb.output.uri", "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb.mycollection") \
    .enableHiveSupport() \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read data from MongoDB using the defined schema
mongo_df = spark.read \
    .format("com.mongodb.spark.sql.DefaultSource") \
    .option("schema", hive_schema.json()) \
    .load()

# Write the data to the Hive table, with schema merging enabled
mongo_df.write \
    .format("hive") \
    .option("mergeSchema", "true") \
    .mode("append") \
    .saveAsTable("mytable")
